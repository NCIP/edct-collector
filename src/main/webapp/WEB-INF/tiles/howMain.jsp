Welcome to the Health of Women Study (HOW), the first ever online "cohort" study of one million women.
 <br/><br/>
 You might be wondering what is a "cohort study?"  A cohort is a study that looks at a group of people over time, collecting data that can be analyzed to find the common risk factors or characteristics.  The HOW Study will be looking at breast cancer risk factors in order to understand the cause of the disease and ways to prevent it.  This will be the first time such a large study is done entirely online.
<br/><br/>
 We are inviting you to be part of the HOW Study because you have signed up to be part of the <a class="pageLink"  href= "HTTP://www.armyofwomen.org" style="text-decoration:none" rel="external">Love/Avon Army of Women</a> and are eager to help us understand the cause of breast cancer and how to prevent it.

<br/><br/>
 The HOW Study is an extension to the Army of Women. It is being conducted by the <a class="pageLink"  href= "HTTP://www.dslrf.org" style="text-decoration:none" rel="external">Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation,</a> in collaboration with the <a class="pageLink"  href="HTTP://www.cityofhope.org" style="text-decoration:none" rel="external" >Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope,</a> You can continue to be part of the Army of Women and not take part in the HOW Study or you can do both.  
 <br/><br/>
 <b>Why did we decide to launch the HOW Study?</b> Because many of you expressed to us your level of frustration with the lack of 
 progress breast cancer research has made, and your desire to do more.  This is your chance to take that extra step and be part of a bigger project.  From the start, we envision this as a joint effort! Together, we will explore the possibilities and make and test hypotheses as we model a new way to do breast cancer research.
<br/><br/> 
 As a member of the HOW Study and the Army of Women, you will be receiving "modules" that will ask key questions about your health and family history.  Each new module is released as part of a "call to action" email.  Each module will be dedicated to a specific topic, and the topics will include data about your health history, reproductive health, cancer history (for those with breast cancer) and much more.  The modules will eliminate the need to ask every single question about your health history at once, which is the  traditional way of doing this type of research and can be overwhelming for the user. Instead, we plan to release a new module every two to three months.  Each module should take about 15-20 minutes to complete.
<br/><br/> 

You can chose to skip a module or to participate in all modules.  You can fill out a module at a later time or catch up on several modules at once. As a member of the HOW Study and the Army of Women, YOU are in complete control and can self select what you want to take part in.
<br/><br/>
This approach is great because it gives us lots of time to ask every question any of us ever wanted answered, and we can conduct this research over time. We can even plunk in a timely question or one that you have proposed. The HOW Study is a work in progress.  We will try a number of different ways of asking questions and collecting data.
<br/><br/> 
As the data is entered, we will be able to analyze some of it immediately and let you know what we find.  Other questions will be answered by following you over time. We will also be working with researchers around the country to do sub-studies and to answer more specific questions.  
<br/><br/>
Every step of the way we want YOUR input. Would you like to hear from us more often or less? Longer modules or shorter? Please let us know. This is YOUR study.
