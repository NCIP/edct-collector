					<b>Background</b><BR>
					With 1 in 8 women expected to develop breast cancer in their lifetime, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the 
					United States. On January 1, 2006, in the United States there were approximately 2,533,193 women alive who had a history of breast
					cancer. No one knows the exact causes of breast cancer. Doctors often cannot explain why one women develops breast cancer and another does not.

					<b>Purpose of the Study</b><BR>
					This study, which is funded by the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation, seeks to collect health-related information over a period of time to answer questions that researchers and the general public
					have regarding the cause and prevention of breast cancer.

					<b>What Will Happen During the Study?</b><BR>
					You will be one of approximately one million Love/Avon Army of Women members asked to participate in the study. You will be provided access to 
					a series of on-line surveys called "modules". Each module will ask a different set of questions related to medical history, reproductive
					health history, diet and exercise, and other areas of health and well-being. The answers you provide to the questions in the module
					will become your "research data". You will also be asked to provide your name and contact information so that we will have the ability to
					contact you should your email change and we lose touch with you. Your name and contact information will be linked to your research data.
					<BR><BR>By participating fully, you will contribute to a greater understanding of what causes breast cancer
					so we may develop approaches that may reduce women's risk and among women already diagnosed with breast cancer, whether adopting certain
					lifestyle factors will add to treatment and improve survival.

					medical history, reproductive health history, lifestyle, environmental exposures, and family health history. 
					You will be notified periodically by e-mail when a module is available for completion. We request that you 
					complete modules as you receive them. Once you've begun a module, you will be able to save your responses and return at a later time to 
					complete the rest of the questions. Once you complete a module and submit your responses, you will no longer be able to make changes.
